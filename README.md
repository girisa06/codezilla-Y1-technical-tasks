F1- Sum of digits: 
An integer input is converted to string and stored in N. 
The FOR loop, runs a variable ‘i’ through each digit of the integer and i is added to the sum with each iteration. 
This sum is displayed after the loop as the Sum of digits.

F2- Leap Year: 
An integer input is obtained as the year. 
If the year satisfies the condition of divisibility by 400 or only 4 and not 100, the year is displayed as a leap year.

F3- Reverse String: 
A string input ‘word’ is obtained and an empty string 'newWord' is initialised. 
The characters of the word are looped from last to first character using a FOR loop, and concatenated to newWord with each iteration. 
The new string is displayed as the reversed string.
